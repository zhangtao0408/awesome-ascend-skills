# Upstream vLLM Test Analysis & Adaptation for Ascend NPU

This skill covers two tightly linked workflows for the vllm-ascend project:

1. **Failure Analysis** — Diagnose why an upstream vLLM test fails on Ascend NPU, classify the root cause, and determine whether a fix is feasible.
2. **Test Adaptation** — Copy an upstream vLLM test into vllm-ascend, adapt it to NPU conventions, debug it until it passes (or conclusively prove it cannot), and make it CI-ready.

Both workflows share the same environment setup and root-cause methodology. The key constraint throughout is: **never modify upstream vLLM code** — only the test code (once copied into vllm-ascend) and vllm-ascend plugin code may be changed.

## 1. Check Existing Analysis First

Before analyzing any test, check whether prior work already covers it — this avoids duplication and ensures consistency.

**Decision tree:**

1. Read `references/ASCEND_ALL_128_TEST_ANALYSIS.md` — the consolidated summary table covering 128 tests with root cause, CI verdict, and "should Ascend pass" classification. If the target test appears here and the vllm/vllm-ascend versions haven't changed significantly since the analysis date (2026-03-27), use the existing conclusion. Only re-analyze if the user explicitly requests a fresh run or versions have changed.

2. If the test appears in `references/TEST_FILES_NEED_ANALYSIS.md` but NOT in the summary table, it is a known target that has not yet been analyzed. Proceed to full analysis.

3. If the test does not appear in either file, it is a new target. Proceed to full analysis.

**For deeper details** on tests 31–61 (exact failure traces, mitigations tried), read `references/ASCEND_31_61_TEST_ANALYSIS.md`.

## 2. Environment Setup

Complete these steps before running any tests. Each step matters — skipping one often produces misleading failures that waste debugging time.

1. **Discover workspace paths.** Check in order: paths provided by the user → environment variables `$VLLM_WORKSPACE` / `$VLLM_ASCEND_WORKSPACE` → common locations `/vllm-workspace/vllm` and `/vllm-workspace/vllm-ascend` → search the user's home directory. Confirm both repo paths before proceeding.

2. **Select idle NPU cards.** Run `npu-smi info` to find cards with no running processes. Set `export ASCEND_RT_VISIBLE_DEVICES=<idle_card_ids>` (e.g., `6,7`). Using cards with existing workloads causes OOM and misleading failures.

3. **Source Ascend toolkit.** `source /usr/local/Ascend/ascend-toolkit/set_env.sh`

4. **Configure model downloads.** Try `export HF_ENDPOINT=https://hf-mirror.com` first. If the HF mirror fails, fall back to `export VLLM_USE_MODELSCOPE=True`. If ModelScope also lacks the model, fall back to Hugging Face with proxy.

5. **Set proxy if needed.** For China mainland environments, configure `http_proxy`/`https_proxy`/`all_proxy`. Always set `no_proxy=localhost,127.0.0.1` — without this, localhost requests route through the proxy and cause server-startup timeouts.

6. **Preserve PYTHONPATH.** Always append: `export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/vllm:$PYTHONPATH`. Overwriting loses Ascend toolkit paths and causes silent import failures.

**Record the environment** for every analysis: vllm commit/version, vllm-ascend commit/version, Python, torch, torch-npu, CANN versions, and whether external network is available.

## 3. Test Adaptation Workflow

This section covers how to take an upstream vLLM test and adapt it for vllm-ascend. The fundamental rule: **upstream vLLM code is read-only** — all changes go into the test copy (inside vllm-ascend) or the vllm-ascend plugin code.

### 3.1 Determine the Target Location

The test's destination in vllm-ascend depends on what it tests:

| Test type | Destination directory | Reason |
|-----------|----------------------|--------|
| Pure unit test (no NPU hardware needed) | `tests/ut/<subdomain>/` | Runs in mocked env, no real hardware |
| End-to-end with single NPU | `tests/e2e/singlecard/` | Standard singlecard e2e |
| End-to-end with multiple NPUs | `tests/e2e/multicard/2-cards/` or `4-cards/` | Matches TP/PP requirements |
| Nightly / heavy benchmark | `tests/e2e/nightly/single_node/` | Too slow for presubmit |
| Upstream interface verification | `tests/e2e/vllm_interface/` | Tests that exercise vLLM interfaces against Ascend |

Most upstream tests from `vllm/tests/` map to `tests/e2e/singlecard/` unless they specifically need multi-card or are pure-logic unit tests.

### 3.2 Copy and Adapt the Test File

1. **Copy the test file** into the chosen destination directory. If the test imports helpers from sibling files (e.g., `conftest.py`, `utils.py` in the same upstream directory), check whether vllm-ascend's `tests/e2e/conftest.py` already provides equivalents before copying upstream helpers.

2. **Add the required license header** at the top of every new file:

   ```python

   # Adapted from vllm-project/vllm/blob/main/tests/<original/path>
   #
   ```

3. **Fix imports.** Key replacements:
   - `from tests.conftest import ...` → use `from tests.e2e.conftest import ...` (the vllm-ascend e2e conftest already provides `VllmRunner`, `HfRunner`, `RemoteOpenAIServer`, `cleanup_dist_env_and_memory`, etc.)
   - `from tests.e2e.model_utils import check_outputs_equal, ...` for output comparison utilities
   - Remove any `import triton` / CUDA-specific imports that aren't needed
   - Do NOT call `adapt_patch()` in individual test files — it's already called in `conftest.py`

4. **Replace CUDA-specific constructs:**
   - `torch.cuda.device_count()` → `torch.npu.device_count()` or use `current_platform` from vllm
   - `DeviceConfig("cuda")` → `DeviceConfig("npu")`
   - `@pytest.mark.skipif(not torch.cuda.is_available(), ...)` → replace with NPU availability checks, or remove if the test should always run on NPU
   - `cuda` in device strings → `npu`
   - CUDA-specific kernel tests or Triton GPU kernel calls — these typically cannot be adapted and should be documented as "reject" with clear rationale

5. **Apply vllm-ascend e2e conventions:**
   - Use `VllmRunner` as a context manager (its `__exit__` auto-cleans memory)
   - Set `os.environ["VLLM_WORKER_MULTIPROC_METHOD"] = "spawn"` at module level for tests that load models
   - Pass `gpu_memory_utilization=0.7` (or appropriate value) explicitly to avoid OOM
   - For ACLGraph: use `cudagraph_capture_sizes=[1, 2, 4, 8]` when needed, or `enforce_eager=True` to disable
   - Use `@pytest.fixture(autouse=True)` with `monkeypatch` for test-scoped env vars

6. **Handle model references:** Use HuggingFace Hub IDs (e.g., `"Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B"`) or vllm-ascend specific IDs (e.g., `"vllm-ascend/Qwen3-0.6B-W8A8"`). Never use local filesystem paths. If the original test uses a model unavailable on the HF mirror or ModelScope, note this as a precondition issue.

### 3.3 Iterative Debug Loop

After copying and adapting, run the test and iterate:

```
while test fails:
    1. Run: pytest -sv tests/e2e/singlecard/test_<name>.py 2>&1 | tee /tmp/test_output.log
    2. Capture the FIRST real failure (ignore cascading errors)
    3. Classify: is this environmental noise or a real issue?
       - Environmental → fix (install dep, set proxy, select different card) → rerun
       - Real failure → diagnose root cause (see §4)
    4. Fix: modify the test copy or vllm-ascend plugin code (never upstream vLLM)
    5. Rerun and verify
```

Keep a log of every change made and every error encountered. This record is essential for the final report and for reproducing results.

### 3.4 When the Test Cannot Pass

If after thorough debugging you conclude the test cannot pass on Ascend NPU, produce a clear root-cause report:

1. **State the conclusion explicitly**: "This test cannot currently pass on Ascend NPU because..."
2. **Provide the root cause category** (see §4 classification table)
3. **Show the evidence**: exact error message, traceback, code path analysis
4. **Explain why a fix is infeasible** (e.g., requires upstream changes, hardware doesn't support the op, would break the plugin's architecture)
5. **Suggest next steps** if any: upstream issue to file, future hardware support, workaround for partial coverage

## 4. Root-Cause Classification

The goal is to find the true root cause, not stop at the first error message. Many surface failures (network timeouts, missing deps) mask deeper issues.

1. **Run the target test(s)** and capture the first real failure.
2. **Eliminate environmental noise.** Download models, install missing deps, fix proxy issues. Record every mitigation. Don't stop at "network issue" if a workaround can expose a deeper failure.
3. **Read the relevant code paths** before concluding. If the failure crosses the adaptation boundary (traceback touches both `vllm` and `vllm-ascend`), inspect both repositories.
4. **Classify the root cause:**

| Category | Meaning | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `vllm-ascend adaptation gap` | Plugin missed upstream branching/dispatch logic | LoRA wrapper selection missing `packed_modules_list` check |
| `upstream test hardcoded CUDA` | Test assumes CUDA device, API, or kernel | `DeviceConfig("cuda")`, `torch.cuda.device_count()` |
| `runtime feature gap` | NPU doesn't support required op or quantization | `fp8 quantization not supported on NPU` |
| `test precondition` | Missing dependency, model, or resource (resolvable) | `runai-model-streamer` not installed |
| `compiler/runtime compatibility` | torch.compile / ACL graph / dynamo issues | `torch._dynamo.exc.InternalTorchDynamoError` |
| `environment/resource` | OOM, proxy, network, card contention | Free memory below `gpu_memory_utilization` threshold |

5. **Determine ownership**: Is the fix needed in `vllm-ascend` plugin, the test copy, upstream `vllm` (documenting as "cannot fix in plugin alone"), or the runtime stack?

## 5. Testcase Selection & CI Tiering

### Selection Principles

A test is a strong CI candidate if it:
- Validates an upstream behavior contract that vllm-ascend must preserve
- Exercises an Ascend-sensitive adaptation boundary (plugin loading, platform dispatch, custom op registration, compiler fallback)
- Is stable and reproducible in a controlled CI environment
- Has high signal-to-noise ratio — failures indicate real regressions
- Has manageable setup cost (model size, startup time, dependency footprint)
- Behaves deterministically under fixed inputs, seeds, and environment

### CI Tier Definitions

- **presubmit**: Lightweight, stable, high-signal. Fast (<5 min), no large model downloads, small models only. Run on every commit.
- **nightly**: Valid coverage but slower or heavier. May require model downloads or multi-card setups.
- **manual**: Worth keeping for manual regression but not suitable for automated CI.
- **reject**: CUDA/ROCm/Triton GPU-specific, benchmark-only, or operationally flaky. Not applicable to Ascend.

### Priority Tiers

- **P0 — Core compatibility guards**: Tests verifying vllm-ascend doesn't break core upstream semantics or public APIs
- **P1 — Adaptation-boundary guards**: Tests validating integration points where upstream logic meets Ascend-specific adaptation
- **P2 — Feature guards**: Tests for supported Ascend features with regression history (LoRA, multimodal, pooling, serving)
- **P3 — Extended coverage**: Useful confidence but expensive, flaky, or lower-yield for every-commit CI

### Exclusion Rules

Exclude tests that:
- Validate CUDA-only, HIP-only, TPU-only, or Triton GPU-specific backend behavior
- Depend on unstable external network access or unavailable large remote assets
- Are primarily benchmarks or performance characterizations rather than correctness guards
- Are highly flaky due to timing, port collisions, or nondeterministic distributed behavior
- Test features explicitly unsupported on Ascend
- Duplicate coverage already provided by a smaller, more stable test

## 6. Output Templates

### Batch Analysis Table

When summarizing a batch of tests:

```markdown
| # | Test File | Evidence | Root Cause | Category | Should Ascend Pass | CI Verdict | Fixable in vllm-ascend |
|---|-----------|----------|------------|----------|-------------------|------------|----------------------|
| 1 | `tests/lora/test_add_lora.py` | Dynamic | LoRA wrapper selection gap | adaptation gap | Yes | nightly | Yes |
```

After the table, include:
- Dependencies installed and resources cached during analysis
- Test files that do not exist in the checked-out branch
- Top recommended CI additions (grouped by presubmit / nightly)
- Critical actionable fix items

### Adaptation Report

When adapting a specific test, the final report should include:
- **Source**: original upstream test file path
- **Destination**: where it was copied in vllm-ascend
- **Changes made**: list of all modifications (imports, CUDA→NPU replacements, convention adaptations)
- **Test result**: PASS / FAIL with details
- **Root cause** (if FAIL): category, evidence, ownership
- **Plugin fixes applied** (if any): what was changed in vllm-ascend code
- **CI recommendation**: which tier this test belongs in

## 7. Case Studies

Consult case studies when a failure appears in upstream code but only manifests after installing vllm-ascend. This pattern — "works without plugin, breaks with plugin" — almost always points to an adaptation boundary issue in the plugin.

- `references/CASE_LORA_WRAPPER_SELECTION_GAP.md`
    - `vllm-ascend` incomplete migration of upstream LoRA wrapper selection logic causes `IndexError` during `set_lora()`.
    - Key lesson: when failure only appears after installing the plugin and the traceback lands in upstream code, check whether the plugin missed upstream branching conditions (`packed_modules_list`, `output_sizes`) before suspecting upstream itself.
    - Detection pattern: `MergedColumnParallelLinear` + `packed_modules_list` + `output_sizes` + `set_lora` + `IndexError` → suspect wrapper selection mismatch.

## 8. Project Summary

For vllm-ascend, upstream tests should be selected primarily from behavior-contract layers rather than CUDA-specific implementation layers. The goal is to ensure vllm-ascend preserves upstream behavioral contracts, not to reproduce backend-specific implementations.

**High priority**: hardware plugin loading, platform dispatch, CustomOp fallback, config normalization, API/request validation, scheduler and cache semantics, LoRA adapter loading and module mapping, lightweight multimodal input handling, pooling task contracts, OpenAI-compatible API path correctness.

**Lower priority**: CUDA/ROCm/TPU backend-specific, heavily network-dependent, benchmark-oriented, or operationally flaky tests.

**CI strategy**: Presubmit CI should contain the smallest stable subset with high regression signal. Heavier multimodal, runtime-compatibility, and distributed-setup cases should be deferred to nightly CI.
